How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and CRUD

I used Node to for my server and used mongoDB and Mlab to make a database for the comments that 21 savage fans post thier comments. I used click events to allows people to thumbs up or thumbs down their favorite comments. After a user picks a thumbs up or thumbs down the pages refreshes displaying the new value and updates the database. 

Optimizations
If I had extra time to go back to and have the application to display the top 10 comments of the day so that everytime 21 savage came to the site he could see the top 10 everytime he would enter the site. 

Lessons Learned:
I learned how to utilize express and mongoDB to build full stack apps. I also learned hows to apply CRUD to building full stack aps.
